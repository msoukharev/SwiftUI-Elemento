# SwiftUIElemento

SwiftuiUI Elemento provides SwiftUI elements for sleek and functional user interface.

## Motivation

SwiftUI Elemento is designed to provide UI components in addition to the stock ones provided by Apple.

## Development and contributions

The package is in its pre-release version for the forseeable future. SwiftUI component customization is limiter. In order to customize. To make up for it, I am using *SwiftUI Introspect*. Because SwiftUI is constantly evolving and gaining new functionalities and SwiftUI Introspect being still in development, it would be preferable to drop *SwiftUI Instrospect* at some point.

Clone the repository and feel free to add your UI elements or models. The feature set is not set in stone yet, and the scope of the project is flexible.
