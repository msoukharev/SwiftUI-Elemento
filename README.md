# SwiftUIElemento

SwiftuiUI Elemento provides SwiftUI elements for sleek and functional user interface.

## Development and contributions

The package is in its pre-release version for the forseeable future. SwiftUI is curerntly missing some crucial functionalities. To make up for it, I am using *SwiftUI Introspect*. Because SwiftUI is constantly evolving and gaining new functionalities and SwiftUI Introspect being still in development, it would be preferable to drop *SwiftUI Instrospect* at some point.

Clone the repository and feel free to add your UI elements or models. The feature set is not set in stone yet, and the scope of the project is flexible.

## Getting started

In XCode:

1. Create or open your existing iOS project
2. Go to File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency
3. Add the package using its GitHub HTTPS URL
4. Import the package and start using 

## Dependencies

* SwiftUI Instrospect [0.1.0]
